### Evan Thacker


At age 13, I picked up a book on designing websites and read underneath my history book in class. I started to program and build websites in the early 2000's. Then, I started to do both freelance work for small businesses.

In 2017, I was did marketing automation on Hubspot and Web Design on Wordpress work for CEA Marketing, an advertising agency handling regional and International clients.

In January 2018, I was accepted by Google and Udacity on a development scholarship, which allowed me to build both android apps and object oriented programs in python.

In August of 2018, I began freelancing basic websites and marketing automation campaigns with my own company, ET Creative Studios.
